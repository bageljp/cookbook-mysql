# This logname can be set in /etc/my.cnf
# by setting the variable "err-log"
# in the [safe_mysqld] section as follows:
#
# [safe_mysqld]
# err-log=/var/log/mysqld.log
#
# If the root user has a password you have to create a
# /root/.my.cnf configuration file with the following
# content:
#
# [mysqladmin]
# password = <secret>
# user= root
#
# where "<secret>" is the password.
#
# ATTENTION: This /root/.my.cnf should be readable ONLY
# for root !

# Then, un-comment the following lines to enable rotation of mysql's log file:

/var/log/mysqld.log /var/lib/mysql/*.log {
    create 640 mysql mysql
    daily
    rotate <%= node['mysql']['logrotate'] %>
    dateext
    missingok
    postrotate
    # just if mysqld is really running
    if test -x /usr/bin/mysqladmin && \
        /usr/bin/mysqladmin ping &>/dev/null
    then
        /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p<%= node['mysql']['root_password'] %> flush-logs
    fi
    endscript
